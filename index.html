                <h2>Napsali o nás</h2>
                <p>Lorem ipsum in the good ol’ days. We are just getting started. We are on the ground floor. Success feeds pride. Pride kills urgency. So nothing fails like success. We always bring our best. Nothing is more fun than serving God with people you love. We are spiritual contributors not spiritual consumers. We give up things we love for things we love move. We are all about the capital C Church. We impress people with our strengths but we connect with people through our weaknesses. We are faith-filled, big-thinking, bet-the-farm risk takers. We will never insult God with safe thinking and safe living. People need to be reminded much more than they need to be instructed. We believe the local church is the hope of the world. Trust the process. What you fear the most reveals where you trust God the least. We can do infinitely more together than we can apart. We want to be known for what we are for, not for what we are against.  If we live with integrity, nothing else matters. You don’t have to have the faith to finish, just the faith to start. The Church should be a place where people can belong before they believe. If we don’t live with integrity, nothing else matters. What you hear matters and what you don’t hear matters. We will do anything short of sin to reach people who don’t know Christ. We will laugh hard, loud, and often.  Less is more. Stress is bad. Giving is good. Tomorrow matters. To reach people no one is reaching, we’ll have to do what no one is doing. Just because God is silent doesn’t mean God is absent. Excellence honors God and inspires people. The church does not exist for us. We are the Church, and we exist for the world. Because of what He did, this is what we do. We are a micro-church with a mega-vision.  An average plan implemented today is better than an great plan started a month from now. The difference between where you are and where God wants you to be is the pain you’re unwilling to endure.</p>
